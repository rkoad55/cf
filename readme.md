## CF Panel

This is a Laravel 5.8 adminpanel starter project with roles-permissions management based on [Joseph Silber's Bouncer package](https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer), [AdminLTE theme](https://adminlte.io/) and [Datatables.net](https://datatables.net).





## Usage

This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

- Clone the repository with `git clone`
- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit database credentials there
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Run `php artisan migrate --seed` (it has some seeded data - see below)
